#### Yo.
This is a repository for the labs/homework I have completed for the EBIO5240 Computational Biology course. 

This class is **hard af**, but it's a good intro to learning all the tools you need to be a hacker genius, so check out [Sam's github](
https://github.com/flaxmans/CompBio_on_git) and don't get discouraged, just keep at it. 🤙🏾
